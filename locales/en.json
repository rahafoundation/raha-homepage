    "title": "Universal Basic Income to End Extreme Poverty",
    "p1": "It's the dawn of a fourth industrial revolution, with artificial intelligence and robotics creating unprecedented wealth. The world’s economy is larger than ever before, and it’s only going to get bigger. But that enormous value is not going to everyday people, but instead to the elites. Technology means the 1% can put their money to work instead of working themselves. This unprecedented decline in wage share from people who work for a living is unsustainable and immoral. Economic security should not be based on one’s parents or country of birth, but instead a basic human right.",
    "p2": "A small basic income could have a transformative effect on the global economy if enough people receive it. Imagine $1 a day. In the short term this would end extreme poverty in the most impoverished countries where basic goods and services are less expensive, and in the long-term contribute to worldwide economic development and international stability. Over 18 years a person would receive over $6500 - which is more than 60% of the world has in savings. A universal basic income raises the floor, so that people can start on a more equal playing field and take steps to invest in their future like buying a home or attending school.",
    "p3": "With Raha, the ambition is to make universal basic income just that: <b>universal</b>. It won’t only go to people in a certain neighborhoods, income brackets, or countries, but to everybody, by the virtue of being a part of our global community. We're kicking it off by enabling anyone who can prove their identity to mint Raha, but we’re hoping that our unique identity platform enables partnerships with real currencies in the future."

  "whyTrust": {
    "title": "Trusted Identities for Safe and Secure Payments",
    "p1": "As technology and globalization spread, so too does international interdependency. Today we might find ourselves buying food from a stranger, getting a ride from a peer, or even staying in someone else’s home when traveling! This is difficult for our human brains that evolved to understand roughly 150 people. So, technology to the rescue! We have news and review apps that helps us understand everything from foreign governments to celebrities lives to local restaurants.",
    "p2": "Unfortunately on many of these sites, fake news, paid-for reviews, and troll accounts have proliferated. This is understandable, as these profit-driven companies have to grow fast. However, it also decreases the long-term usability and value of these identity networks.",
    "p3": "At Raha, we believe that every real identity has value. That is why members with a verified identity can mint their own Raha, as they help prevent a Sybil attack from taking over the network. And more members means more value. The total value of a network usually grows in proportion to the square of the number of people connected. This hypothesis is known as Metcalfe’s Law, and has been empirically confirmed at a large scale with the rise of Facebook and Tencent.",
    "p4": "At Raha, we are creating an economy that belongs to everyone. We believe decentralized platforms that enable people to connect and help each other directly will create progress, connection, and wealth. Technologies that connect us also pose enormous challenges, such as fraud and identity theft (which cost us $16.8 billion in the US alone in 2017), and accounts spreading misinformation - an estimated 6-10% of all accounts on Facebook are fake!",
    "p5": "No system is perfect, but our goal is to make it more time and money intensive to generate a fake Raha identity than a fake US passport, which can be obtained for about $1000. This will be done through a variety of methods, starting with video/voice identification and expanding to other biometrics such as fingerprint and iris, linked and timestamped social network activity such as Facebook and LinkedIn, and traditional identity forms such as drivers license and passports. Through a constellation of identity factors different applications can decide what level of trust is needed. Because Raha is invite-only, a giant tree can be formed where clusters of bad actors can be detected and pruned."

    "title": "Delegative Democracy and Values-Based Development",
    "p1": "<em>The history of the distribution of wealth has always been deeply political, and it cannot be reduced to purely economic mechanisms.</em> - <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Piketty\">Piketty</a>",
    "p2": "We believe values-based development is critical to creating standards that lead to a better society for all instead of protocols controlled by a wealthy few such as Bitcoin, which is best known for wasting electricity and facilitating criminal activity. Klaus Tuber, founder of the World Economic Forum, knows this well: \"We can’t possibly increase human wellbeing if we don’t take the time to identify our collective values before creating technology we know will align with those ideals.\" Raha is based on the principle that every life has value. By creating an economic system that reflects this, we can create greater prosperity for all.",
    "p3": "Individuals in fair capitalist systems can make their own merit and bring fantastic wealth to themselves and others through hard work and innovation. However, some systems are extremely unfair. It’s worth examining systemic political changes that have driven wealth inequality of entire populations in many countries, starting with the US. For instance, moving off of the gold standard was a political decision, as is taking on unprecedented levels of debt which reflects very short-term thinking.",
    "p4": "Now that the government feels free to spend so much more money than it takes in, we should examine where this excess money tends to end up. Some of our federal budget goes to very productive programs with long-term returns like education ($102 billion) and transportation ($85 billion). More goes to paying off our existing debt ($229 billion - which is expected to rapidly increase) funding the military industrial complex ($609 billion) and on big bank bailouts. As more money flows into politics, people become rich from crony capitalism instead of fair markets and innovation. This is part of why the income of the upper 1% has risen so dramatically since 1970.",
    "p5": "Today we have the world’s most established constitutional democracy working for the rich rather than the people. The resulting populist backlash makes short-term, reactionary decisions based on headlines instead of creating long-term plans for prosperity. The engines driving our economy have been hijacked to benefit the wealthy, while simplistic partisan issues divide and distract voters. We believe that a truly delegative democracy could make better long-term economic decisions. For this reason Raha is controlled by the Raha Parliament. Raha makes voting more effective and equal by allowing us to support any other member instead of having to choose amongst the tiny number who have enough money and influence to run for election.",
    "p6": "But how will we create an effective collective that can quickly improve and agree on a realistic path forwards? We want a hybrid system: delegative democracy where your default vote goes to the person who invited you to join Raha. You can change your vote at any time to ensure that the developments always stays in line with the will of the people.",
    "p7": "At the beginning, this default gives a huge advantage to early members who are passionate about spreading Raha. This delegative democracy is still highly experimental and the ramifications not fully understood. Initially in order to nominate yourself, you will have to be approved as a valid account with good intentions by the majority of the existing Raha Parliament. We expect many modifications will be necessary. Over time, as Raha becomes more important and people care more about what the Raha Parliament does with their budget, we believe members will be more likely to change their vote. When you change your vote, this could mean voting directly for someone who is running for Raha Parliament, or giving your vote to anyone not already indirectly voting for you. This means you can give it to anyone you know who has similar values to you and you trust will research the relevant issues well. We hope that it leads to a more personalized and productive form of politics. Instead of making decisions from a tiny pool of candidates based on headlines fed to us by profit-driven media engines, we can make productive decisions based on a combination of facts and trust in people close to us."
